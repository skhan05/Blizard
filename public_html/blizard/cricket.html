<h1>How I Met Team Blizzard?</h1>

<p>After coming to  USA in 2013, I met a guy in school, who was a senior. One day he asked me if I know how to play cricket and i replied yes. Few days later he told me about the team that he's member of and asked me if I'm interested to play few games with them. So, happily I accpeted that offer and went to meet their team members and played some pratcise matches. After seeing my skills, they invited me to play a real game with some other local team. So I accepted that offer and perticipated in that game and played great
